Couple these reasons with my interest in innate dog behavior (and Peter&#39;s support of this), made signing up for TWIN&#39;s (<a href="http://www.timberwolfinformation.org">Timber Wolf Information Network</a>) workshop on Wolf Ecology an easy choice!</p><p>Before moving to Wisconsin, we did informal tracking of coyotes in New Hampshire. I had always yearned for more... unfortunately, the prospect of wolf tracking was never an option in New England (they have been exterminated), so when t...</p><a href="posts/winter-wolf-ecology-workshop-2014.html">Read more...</a></div><div class="post-snippet"><h2>In The News...</h2><p></p><p>Jul 14, 2012</p><p></p><p>Lynn presented &quot;CBADDC&quot; (Canine Behavior and Doggie Day Care) at the popular New England Pet Grooming Professionals (NEPGP) Summerfest in Warwick, RI on July 14, 2012. While attending and presenting, Lynn was taken by surprise to find out her clients, had voted her TOP DOG in NEPGP&#39;s annual contest (derived soley from client voting)! It was a great honor and testimonial to Wunderdog! Lynn wishes to THANK each and every one of her Wunderdog families for taking the time to vote and making her feel incredibly loved and valued!</p><a href="posts/in-the-news.html">Read more...</a></div><div class="post-snippet"><h2>Gilda The Great Book Update!</h2><p></p><p>May 1, 2012</p><p></p><p>As most of our clients have already heard, Lynn and her daughter Laney (an artist/illustrator/animator/videographer) have started their first book about &quot;Gilda,&quot; the sweet little character Laney rescued from a shelter out west. Laney has begun the illustrations, and we are hoping to complete the book in 2013.</p><p>The book will center around Gilda&#39;s start in her new life with &quot;Ida Mae McDougal,&quot; a elderly ranch owner in Sante Fe, NM. Special little Gilda will be named &quot;Gilda Rose McDougal&quot; for unique reasons by Ida Mae. What is even more interesting is that the book is based on the true story of Gilda&#39;s rescue (a cause near-and-dear to all of our hearts!).</p><p>STAY TUNED for sneak peeks, pictures and progress-updates!</p><a href="posts/gilda-the-great-book-update.html">Read more...</a></div><div class="post-snippet"><h2>Choosing The Right Breed For You and Your Family</h2><p></p><p>Mar 1, 2012</p><p></p><p>Dogs of many sizes, shapes and personalities are available for purchase or adoption. The main thing that you, the potential owner, must recognize and understand, is that BEFORE you commit, you must have all the facts.</p><p>Do you want an athletic dog? A dog that is sedentary? A fast learner? A &quot;vocal dog?&quot; A friendly-to-all-people dog? A dog to alert you in the case of danger? What type of daily (or weekly) brushing or combing would you find reasonable? How much money are you willing to spend on routine supplies such as food or professional grooming? WHat about potential health issues common to a specific breed? Do you want a toy, small, medium, large, or giant breed?</p><p>Often following a movie that is based on a particular type dog, there is an increase in that breed&#3...</p><a href="posts/choosing-the-right-breed.html">Read more...</a></div><div class="post-snippet"><h2>Backyard Breeders.... Who are They?</h2><p></p><p>Feb 1, 2012</p><p><h2 id="what-does-this-title-mean-">What does this title mean?</h2></p><p>These are the people, who purchase a &quot;purebred&quot; dog with (most likely) AKC or &quot;America&#39;s Pet Registry, Inc.&quot; papers who think that their animal is a good candidate for breeding. The reasoning usually goes like this: &quot;I want my children to experience a mother giving birth and caring for her offspring.&quot; Or, &quot;We think our dog is so wonderful, she should have puppies so that other people can have a wonderful dog too.&quot; Perhaps they say, &quot;I&#39;d like my in-tact male to experience <strong>__</strong>.&quot; Whatever the reason, it&#39;s not a GOOD ENOUGH reason.</p><p>Backyard Breeders do not test for potential genetic diseases, general health screenings, or the establishment...</p><a href="posts/backyard-breeders.html">Read more...</a></div><div class="post-snippet"><h2>To Crate, Or Not To Crate... That Is The Question!</h2><p></p><p>Jan 1, 2012</p><p></p><p>Nothing brings more to the table when I first meet with a new client than crate training. Most humans view crating as a &quot;prison,&quot; or consider it cruel to confine a puppy or dog.</p><p>Crate training is a necessity. It a way to teach your dog to have self-restraint (holding his &quot;potty&quot;), it offers structure by creating a routine, it gives the dog a place that he can feel comfortable (consider like a bedroom), and offers you and the dog a &quot;retreat&quot; should things get chaotic in the home. A crate also encourages a pup or dog&#39;s personal cleanliness.</p><p>In the wild, canines have a natural &quot;order&quot; to their pack; a hierarchy system that works for them. They are content because they live in a very structured environment. They are productive (hunti...</p><a href="posts/to-crate-or-not-to-crate.html">Read more...</a></div></article></div><footer><ul><li>&copy; 2014 Wunderdog LLC</li><li><a href="/wunderdog/atom.xml">RSS Feed</a></li></ul></footer><script src="/wunderdog/scripts/app.js"></script></body></html>
